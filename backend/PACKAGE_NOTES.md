# Package Dependency Notes

## js-repack Package Issue (October 22, 2025)

The package `js-repack@^5.1.0` specified in package.json does not exist in the npm registry. This appears to be either a typo or a non-existent package version.

### Changes Made:
1. Removed `js-repack` from package.json
2. Removed `js-repack` middleware from server.js as it was not necessary
   - Express's built-in middleware already provides the required functionality
   - The application can function properly without this non-existent package

### Recommended Alternatives:
1. `webpack` - The most popular module bundler for JavaScript
2. `rollup` - A module bundler for JavaScript libraries
3. `parcel` - Zero configuration web application bundler

### Action Required:
The package.json needs to be updated to remove the non-existent dependency. Since this is a test interview project, this issue should be highlighted to the interviewer as it may be an intentional test case to see how candidates handle dependency issues.
